But what if you are working on a project where project specific libraries are to be installed and used. And all to be setup in a python environment in RStudio?\n\nIt is possible. However, setting up a custom ananconda enrironment and using that specific python version is not that obvious. It is possible, however, if you have some time to spare to figure out from stackoverflow and some github issue queue and elsewhere.\n\nThankfully, I've figured it out after spending a couple of hours. I thought I would document this just in case I need it later or someone else might need it.\n\nHere it is.\n\n# Steps at a glance\n\n-   Create python environment using [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download). I use this because it is easy to use\n-   Install the necessary libraries in that environment\n-   Create a Quarto project in RStudio\n-   Set the project-specific `Renviron`\n-   Set the Python interpreter for your project in Rstudio\n-   Check if quarto and Jupyter is properly connected to the python version you want\n-   Render\n\n# Setting up Anaconda\n\nI will skip this section assuming that you either have Anaconda installed or you are managing your python environment in some other ways. If you need help with that, please search on YouTube and there are good videos on this topic.\n\n# Setting up RStudio\n\nThe first this is to to create a separate Rstudio project to house your code and documents. We're obviously using Pyhon with the Jupyter engine to run the Quarto document.\n\n## Check your current jupyter engine\n\nFrom within Rstudio, uset the Terminal tab (bottom left panel). It should open termina within Rstudio. On the CLI, type the following\n\n``` bash\nquarto check jupyter\n```\n\nThis should produce an output like the following:\n\n``` bash\n[✓] Checking Python 3 installation....OK\n      Version: 3.8.13 (Conda)\n      Path: /Users/enayetraheem/opt/anaconda3/envs/ibis3813/bin/python\n      Jupyter: 4.10.0\n      Kernels: python3\n\n[✓] Checking Jupyter engine render....OK\n```\n\nNotice that it shows the current Python engine, which is `/Users/enayetraheem/opt/anaconda3/envs/ibis3813`. Also we can see the Jupyter version here.\n\n**Where does Rstudio get this information from?**\n\nThe short answer is: from the global `.Renviron` file. In the current Renviron, this is what I have.\n\n``` bash\nQUARTO_PYTHON=/Users/enayetraheem/opt/anaconda3/envs/ibis3813/bin/python\n```\n\nIf you want to use this python environment, then you are good. It should run Pyton without issues. Also make sure new libraries are installed in this environment for you to use them in this notebook.\n\n## The problem\n\nThe problem occurs when you want to use a different environment! The one you see above is the global environment. This will be chosen by RStudio unless you specify a project specific `.Renviron`.\n\nThe solution seems easy that you want to set the project specific environment from the Tools?\n\nLets take a look at the current setup.\n\n![](rstudio-project-config1.png)\n\nThere is no Python interpreter set for the current project. We can set one but that won't actually work.\n\nLet's set the python interpreter to be the following:\n\n![](rstudio-project-config2.png)\n\nNow lets restart RStudio just in case. And check back quarto\n\nWhen you run `quarto check jupyer`, you would get the same response as before, and not the Pyton you've set up with as the screenshot above.\n\n## The solution\n\nThe solution is to set project specific `.Renviron`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nusethis::edit_r_environ(scope = \"project\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen you execute this, it will open up the editor where you can put the following information \n\n``` bash\nQUARTO_PYTHON=/Users/enayetraheem/opt/anaconda3/envs/chasing-python/bin/python3.11\n```\n\n## Restart \n\nMake sure to restart your entire RStudio and then reopen the project. Then run in the terminal the \n\n```bash\nquarto check jupyter\n```\n\nwhich should render the following\n\n\n```bash\n\n[✓] Checking Python 3 installation....OK\n      Version: 3.11.5 (Conda)\n      Path: /Users/enayetraheem/opt/anaconda3/envs/chasing-python/bin/python3.11\n      Jupyter: 5.5.0\n      Kernels: python3\n\n\n[✓] Checking Jupyter engine render....OK\n```\n\n## Summary\n\nThis article demonstrated the steps to set a Python interpreter in a local RStudio project. We used Anaconda Python package manager to create and manage the envs. Then we use `usethis::edit_r_environ()` library with `scope=\"project\"` argument to edit the project specific python interpreter.\n",
