I'm a healthcare data scientist with a statistics background. As a Principal Data Scientist at [ICON](https://www.iconplc.com), I currently support [Incyte Pharmaceutical Company](htts://incyte.com) in their Data Science and Innovation group.

I have been supporting healthcare providers (hospitals/EHR data), payors (medical claims), and bio-pharma (RWD, RWE, clinical trials) for over 8 years now.

I have 20+ years of experience coding in R, 8+ years with Python in on-prem and cloud environments.

I love both R and Python. To me, these are just the tools of trades and I use the one that is the most appropriate for the problem at hand. 

I am passionate about teaching and sharing my experience with early career data professionals. I am the founder and chief instructor at [dataskool](https://dataskool.org), an online learning platform in Bangla language for approachable data science and AI training.
