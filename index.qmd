I am a data scientist holding a Ph.D. in statistics and currently serving as a Principal Clinical Data Scientist at [ICON](https://www.iconplc.com), where I support the Data Science and Innovation group. 

Over the past 8 years, my experience has covered diverse areas, including assisting healthcare providers with hospital and electronic health record (EHR) data, supporting payors with medical claims analytics, and collaborating with bio-pharma on Real-World Data (RWD) for Real-World Evidence (RWE) generation, and clinical trials data.

In terms of programming expertise, I have more than 20 years of experience in R and over 8 years with Python, both in on-premises and cloud computing environments. I am proficient in both languages and select the most suitable one depending on the specific problem.

Furthermore, I have a strong passion for teaching and sharing my knowledge with emerging data professionals. I am the founder and chief instructor at [dataskool](https://dataskool.org), an online learning platform dedicated to providing accessible data science and AI training for Bengali-speaking audiences.
