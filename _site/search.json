    "text": "One of the most repeated phrases in any introductory statistics class is the warning that “correlation is not causation.” This chapter presents new non-statistical language for creating, measuring, and evaluating causal stories and relationships using observational (i.e. non-experimental) data. It introduces the concept of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that allow us to formally encode our understanding of causal stories. With well-crafted DAGs, one can use a set of rules called do-calculus to make specific adjustments to statistical models and isolate or identify causal relationships between variables of interest. Edges (or arrows) transmit associations between nodes. Following the fundamental problem of causal inference, answering causal questions without an experiment appears impossible. The chapter explores different methods of making adjustments using synthetic data. Instead of throwing away potentially useful data, one can use other methods to create matches that are less discrete and more informative."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In a project I’m working on, I need to generate predictions from a logistic regression model. That’s typically a really straightforward task—we can just use predict() to plug a dataset of values into a model, which will spit out predictions either on the (gross, uninterpretable) log odds scale or on the (nice, interpretable) percentage-point scale.11 And for pro-level predictions, use predictions() from {marginaleffects}.\nHowever, in this project I cannot use predict()—I’m working with a big matrix of posterior coefficient draws from a Bayesian model fit with raw Stan code, so there’s no special predict() function that will work. Instead, I need to use matrix multiplication and manually multiply a matrix of new data with a vector of slopes from the model.\nI haven’t had to matrix multiply coefficients with data since my first PhD stats class back in 2012 and I’ve completely forgotten how.\nI created this little guide as a reference for myself, and I figured it’d probably be useful for others, so up on the blog it goes (see the introduction to this post for more about my philosophy of public work)."

    "text": "Example 2: Logistic regression model with a categorical predictor and no intercept\nThis gets a little more complex when working with categorical predictors, especially if you’ve omitted the intercept term. For instance, in the data I’m working with, we have a model that looks something like this, with 0 added as a term to suppress the intercept and give separate coefficients for each of the levels of sex:\n\nmodel_categorical &lt;- glm(\n  is_gentoo ~ 0 + sex + bill_length_mm + body_mass_g,\n  data = penguins,\n  family = binomial(link = \"logit\")\n)\ncoef(model_categorical)\n##      sexfemale        sexmale bill_length_mm    body_mass_g \n##      -75.68237      -89.88199        0.03387        0.01831\n\nWhen using predict(), we don’t have to do anything special with this intercept-free model. We can plug in a dataset with different variations of predictors:\n\ndata_to_plug_in_cat &lt;- expand.grid(\n  sex = c(\"female\", \"male\"),\n  bill_length_mm = c(40, 44, 48),\n  body_mass_g = mean(penguins$body_mass_g)\n)\ndata_to_plug_in_cat\n##      sex bill_length_mm body_mass_g\n## 1 female             40        4207\n## 2   male             40        4207\n## 3 female             44        4207\n## 4   male             44        4207\n## 5 female             48        4207\n## 6   male             48        4207\n\npredict(model_categorical, newdata = data_to_plug_in_cat, type = \"link\")\n##       1       2       3       4       5       6 \n##   2.707 -11.493   2.842 -11.357   2.978 -11.222\npredict(model_categorical, newdata = data_to_plug_in_cat, type = \"response\")\n##         1         2         3         4         5         6 \n## 9.374e-01 1.020e-05 9.449e-01 1.169e-05 9.516e-01 1.338e-05\n\nIf we want to do this manually, we have to create a matrix version of data_to_plug_in_cat that has separate columns for sexfemale and sexmale. We can’t just use as.matrix(data_to_plug_in_cat), since that only has a single column for sex (and because that column contains text, it forces the rest of the matrix to be text, which makes it so we can’t do math with it anymore):\n\nas.matrix(data_to_plug_in_cat)\n##      sex      bill_length_mm body_mass_g\n## [1,] \"female\" \"40\"           \"4207\"     \n## [2,] \"male\"   \"40\"           \"4207\"     \n## [3,] \"female\" \"44\"           \"4207\"     \n## [4,] \"male\"   \"44\"           \"4207\"     \n## [5,] \"female\" \"48\"           \"4207\"     \n## [6,] \"male\"   \"48\"           \"4207\"\n\nInstead, we can use model.matrix() to create a design matrix—also called a dummy-encoded matrix2 or a one-hot encoded matrix—which makes columns of 0s and 1s for each of the levels of sex2 Though we should probably quit using the word “dummy” because of its ableist connotations—see Google’s developer documentation style guide for alternatives.\n\ndata_to_plug_in_cat_mat &lt;- model.matrix(\n  ~ 0 + ., data = data_to_plug_in_cat\n)\ndata_to_plug_in_cat_mat\n##   sexfemale sexmale bill_length_mm body_mass_g\n## 1         1       0             40        4207\n## 2         0       1             40        4207\n## 3         1       0             44        4207\n## 4         0       1             44        4207\n## 5         1       0             48        4207\n## 6         0       1             48        4207\n## attr(,\"assign\")\n## [1] 1 1 2 3\n## attr(,\"contrasts\")\n## attr(,\"contrasts\")$sex\n## [1] \"contr.treatment\"\n\nWe can now do math with this matrix.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe phenomenon of closing civic space has adversely impacted INGO funding. We argue that individual private donors can be important in sustaining the operations of INGOs working in repressive contexts. Individual donors do not use the same performance-based metrics as official aid donors. Rather, trust can be an important component of individual donor support for nonprofits working towards difficult goals. How does trust in charitable organizations influence individuals’ preferences to donate, especially when these groups face crackdown? Using a simulated market for philanthropic donations based on data from a nationally representative sample of individuals in the United States who regularly donate to charity, we find that trust in INGOs matters substantially in shaping donor preferences. Donor profiles with high levels of social trust are likely to donate to INGOs with friendly relationships with host governments. This support holds steady if INGOs face criticism or crackdown. In contrast, donor profiles with lower levels of social trust prefer to donate to organizations that do not face criticism or crackdown abroad. The global crackdown on NGOs may thus possibly sour NGOs’ least trusting individual donors. Our findings have practical implications for INGOs raising funds from individuals amid closing civic space."
