    "section": "",
    "text": "One of the most repeated phrases in any introductory statistics class is the warning that “correlation is not causation.” This chapter presents new non-statistical language for creating, measuring, and evaluating causal stories and relationships using observational (i.e. non-experimental) data. It introduces the concept of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that allow us to formally encode our understanding of causal stories. With well-crafted DAGs, one can use a set of rules called do-calculus to make specific adjustments to statistical models and isolate or identify causal relationships between variables of interest. Edges (or arrows) transmit associations between nodes. Following the fundamental problem of causal inference, answering causal questions without an experiment appears impossible. The chapter explores different methods of making adjustments using synthetic data. Instead of throwing away potentially useful data, one can use other methods to create matches that are less discrete and more informative."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe phenomenon of closing civic space has adversely impacted INGO funding. We argue that individual private donors can be important in sustaining the operations of INGOs working in repressive contexts. Individual donors do not use the same performance-based metrics as official aid donors. Rather, trust can be an important component of individual donor support for nonprofits working towards difficult goals. How does trust in charitable organizations influence individuals’ preferences to donate, especially when these groups face crackdown? Using a simulated market for philanthropic donations based on data from a nationally representative sample of individuals in the United States who regularly donate to charity, we find that trust in INGOs matters substantially in shaping donor preferences. Donor profiles with high levels of social trust are likely to donate to INGOs with friendly relationships with host governments. This support holds steady if INGOs face criticism or crackdown. In contrast, donor profiles with lower levels of social trust prefer to donate to organizations that do not face criticism or crackdown abroad. The global crackdown on NGOs may thus possibly sour NGOs’ least trusting individual donors. Our findings have practical implications for INGOs raising funds from individuals amid closing civic space."

    "text": "If you were trying to run a quarto document in Rstudio, it will run fine as long as your default python version has the correct libaries installed. But what if you are working on a project where project specific libraries are to be installed and used. And all to be setup in a python environment in RStudio?\nIt is possible. However, setting up a custom ananconda enrironment and using that specific python version is not that obvious. It is possible, however, if you have some time to spare to figure out from stackoverflow and some github issue queue and elsewhere.\nThankfully, I’ve figured it out after spending a couple of hours. I thought I would document this just in case I need it later or someone else might need it.\nHere it is."
