    "text": "Suppose you were trying to run a quarto document in Rstudio. In that case, it will run fine if your default Python version has the correct libraries installed. But what if you are working on a project where project-specific libraries are to be installed and used? And all to be set up in an Anaconda Python environment in RStudio?\nIt is possible. However, setting up a custom Anaconda environment and using that specific Python version is not apparent. You might have to spend some time to figure out from Stackoverflow and some GitHub issue queues.\nI’ve figured it out after spending a couple of hours. I wanted to document this in case I need it later, or someone else might need it.\nHere it is."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe phenomenon of closing civic space has adversely impacted INGO funding. We argue that individual private donors can be important in sustaining the operations of INGOs working in repressive contexts. Individual donors do not use the same performance-based metrics as official aid donors. Rather, trust can be an important component of individual donor support for nonprofits working towards difficult goals. How does trust in charitable organizations influence individuals’ preferences to donate, especially when these groups face crackdown? Using a simulated market for philanthropic donations based on data from a nationally representative sample of individuals in the United States who regularly donate to charity, we find that trust in INGOs matters substantially in shaping donor preferences. Donor profiles with high levels of social trust are likely to donate to INGOs with friendly relationships with host governments. This support holds steady if INGOs face criticism or crackdown. In contrast, donor profiles with lower levels of social trust prefer to donate to organizations that do not face criticism or crackdown abroad. The global crackdown on NGOs may thus possibly sour NGOs’ least trusting individual donors. Our findings have practical implications for INGOs raising funds from individuals amid closing civic space."

    "text": "Certainly! Focusing specifically on researching and finding internship opportunities in the United States for fresh undergraduates, here are detailed insights and actionable steps to guide you through this crucial phase:\nResearching and Finding Internship Opportunities in the U.S.\nSecuring an internship in the United States is a competitive process that requires strategic research and a proactive approach. Here’s how you can effectively search and apply for internship opportunities:\n1. Start with a Clear Objective\n\n\nDefine Your Goals: Know what you want to gain from your internship experience. Are you looking for specific skills, industry exposure, or a potential pathway to employment? This clarity will guide your search.\n\nIdentify Your Field of Interest: Narrow down the industries and roles that interest you. This focus will make your search more manageable and targeted.\n2. Research Companies\n\n\nCreate a List of Target Companies: Identify companies that align with your career goals and have a history of offering internships. Don’t limit yourself to large corporations; small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and startups can also offer valuable experiences.\n\nCompany Websites: Regularly check the careers section of your target companies’ websites for internship listings. Many companies prefer to post opportunities on their own platforms before advertising elsewhere.\n3. Utilize Online Platforms and Job Boards\n\n\nInternship-Specific Platforms: Websites like Internships.com, WayUp, and Chegg Internships are dedicated to internship listings and can be filtered by location, industry, and role.\n\nGeneral Job Boards: LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, and Monster also list internships. Use filters to narrow down your search to entry-level and internship positions.\n\nIndustry-Specific Websites: Depending on your field, look for niche job boards that specialize in your industry. These can often list internships not found on larger platforms.\n4. Leverage University Resources\n\n\nCareer Services: Your university’s career services office can connect you with internship opportunities and alumni working in your field of interest. They may also have partnerships with companies seeking interns.\n\nJob Fairs and Networking Events: Attend university and external career fairs, as well as industry networking events. These can be excellent opportunities to meet employers and learn about internships firsthand.\n5. Network Effectively\n\n\nInformational Interviews: Reach out to professionals in your field for informational interviews. This is a way to learn about the industry and potentially uncover unadvertised internship opportunities.\n\nSocial Media and Professional Networks: Use LinkedIn to connect with industry professionals and join relevant groups. Engaging with content and participating in discussions can increase your visibility and open up opportunities.\n\nAlumni Networks: Connect with alumni from your university who are working in the U.S. They can offer valuable advice and might know of internship opportunities in their companies.\n6. Attend Industry Conferences and Workshops\n\n\nConferences and Seminars: These events are excellent for learning current industry trends and networking with professionals. Some conferences offer student rates or volunteer opportunities which can provide free or reduced-cost access.\n\nWorkshops and Online Webinars: Participate in workshops and webinars related to your field of interest. These can be platforms for learning and networking.\n7. Monitor Specialized Forums and Newsletters\n\n\nProfessional Forums: Join forums and online communities specific to your industry. Members often share job openings and internship opportunities.\n\nSubscribe to Newsletters: Many industry-specific websites and professional organizations send out newsletters that include job and internship listings.\n8. Apply Strategically\n\n\nCustomize Your Application: Tailor your resume, cover letter, and application materials to each internship opportunity. Highlight relevant skills, experiences, and coursework.\n\nPrepare for the Process: Be ready for a competitive application process. This includes preparing for interviews, potentially taking part in assessment days, and being proactive in follow-ups.\n9. Stay Organized\n\n\nTrack Your Applications: Keep a spreadsheet or use job search apps to track the internships you’ve applied for, including application dates, follow-up actions, and responses.\n10. Be Persistent and Flexible\n\n\nPersistence is Key: The search for an internship can be challenging and may require time and persistence. Don’t get discouraged by rejections.\n\nFlexibility: Be open to a wide range of opportunities, including those that may not be your first choice but offer valuable experience and growth.\n\nBy focusing your efforts on thorough research and strategic application, you can significantly improve your chances of securing an internship in the U.S. Remember, the process is highly competitive, and success often comes to those who are well-prepared, proactive, and persistent in their search.\n\n## Summary\n\nThis article demonstrated the steps to set up a Python interpreter in a local RStudio project.
